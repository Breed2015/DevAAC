This is a directory holding [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) playbook that is used to provision the development environment created by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).


Run ```vagrant up``` in the root directory (above this one) to start a Virtual Machine with this project. Then connect to [http://localhost:8044/](http://localhost:8044/).

Remember that first you need to [install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

This directory is not needed for a real deployment, you can safely delete it.
